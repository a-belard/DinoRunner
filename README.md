# Dino Runner V.112

Inspired by the Chrome Dinosaur game, I reimplemented the game using CMU's cmu_graphics,
adding more graphic components, and some features.

### Features

- Original Chrome Dino features: skipping & ducking obstacles (birds, cactus)
- Added falling Wi-FI meteors (as Wi-Fi being a threat that caused users to directly close the game)
- Battle Mode (fighting with other Dinosaurs)
- Spitting fire
- Game customisation: set desired number of birds, cactus, wi-fi meteors, enemies
- Player Ranking (Didnt get time to finish)
- File based levels and highscore

### Dependencies

- cmu_graphics
- pillow

### Running

python main.py

### Credits

- ![Itch.io](Itch.io): I got almost all the image/gif assets from that site
- Stack overflow: For the collision formula :)
- Anurag (15-112 Mentor): For guiding me & suggesting some features
